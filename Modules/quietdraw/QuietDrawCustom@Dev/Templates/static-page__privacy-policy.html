<h2>Website Security</h2>
<p>The King Ranch Saddle Shop takes your concerns about the security of online ordering very seriously. We've put many safeguards into our electronic store so that you can enjoy your shopping experience and make purchases without having to worry about the safety of credit card transactions. Our secure shopping system is made up of three layers. <br><br>
</p>
<p>The first layer, "Safe Technology", is the most visible to you. Our Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology is an industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. Using RSA key technology, our web server is stable and secure, so you can shop via the web without worry and without risk. We encrypt all of your personal information including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. <br><br>
</p>
<p>The second layer, our "Firewall", works behind the scenes. We protect all of your private information, including your order, behind a network security system. Only our own staff has access to this information, and then only enough to service your order. As a final precaution, we authorize all credit card transactions through the same private channel that we use for traditional phone, fax, or mail orders. If you have any questions about our security system, please Contact Us.
        </p>
<p>We may also collect your email address via cookies and pixels on the Website through the use
of trusted third-party partners.  These partners may also combine your email information with
other information they have access to such as a mailing address so that we may serve relevant
marketing offers to you via email and direct mail.   If you do not want us to collect information
about you, please contact us at <a href="tel:1-877-282-5777">1-877-282-5777</a> or email <a href="mailto:krsaddleshop@king-ranch.com">krsaddleshop@king-ranch.com</a> to opt out.</p>

<h5>How we share your information:</h5>
<p>The information that you give us and information about your order may be combined with
other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past
purchase history) available from our records and other sources.  This information may also be
shared with other marketers to bring you offers of interest.  If you prefer not to share your
name and address with other marketers, please email us at <a href="mailto:krsaddleshop@king-ranch.com">krsaddleshop@king-ranch.com</a>.</p>
