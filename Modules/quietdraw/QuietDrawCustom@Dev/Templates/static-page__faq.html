                  <p>The first layer of security, "Safe Technology", is the most visible to you. Our Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology is an industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. Using RSA key technology, our web server is stable and secure, so you can shop via the web without worry and without risk. We encrypt all of your personal information including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. The second layer, our "Firewall", works behind the scenes. We protect all of your private information, including your order, behind a network security system. Only our own staff has access to this information, and then only enough to service your order. As a final precaution, we authorize all credit card transactions through the same private channel that we use for traditional phone, fax, or mail orders. If you have any questions about our security system, please email us at krsaddleshop@king-ranch.com.</p>

                  <h5>How do I care for the leather or King Ranch Embossed Fabric?</h5>
                  <p>Leather Care: The leather we use in our products will last for many years with proper care. In our experience, the best way to preserve leather is to condition the leather every 3 months with King Ranch Leather Conditioner (item#1053). Do not use oil on any of our leather products. Doing so will turn the leather very dark.</p>
    
                  <p>King Ranch Embossed Fabric Care: The tan-colored materials we use can be washed with water and any non-abrasive soap. We suggest using soap such as Soft Scrub, which does not leave a film. If the material is marked by a ball point pen, it is important to remove the ink before it dries. The best choice for this is our King Ranch Canvas Cleaner (item#216939), 22 fl. oz. spray bottle.</p>
    
                  <p>Spray it on the spot, let it work for 20 to 30 seconds and then wipe it off with a soft cloth. Do not scrub with a lot of pressure or you will dull the surface.</p>
    
                  <h5>How often is the site updated?</h5>

                  <h5>What is the Running W® Brand?</h5>
                  <p>The exact date of Captain Richard King's first use of the brand has not been determined. However, the earliest registration in Texas was on the 9th of February, 1869. There are several theories as to why the Running W was chosen. Some say it originated in Mexico because of its shape. The Mexicans call the brand viborita, which means the little snake. Others believe that it was a simple inversion of the initial M brand, because Captain King purchased the land and livestock of William Mann'?'s estate in 1862. When King Ranch began to operate its own saddlery in the years following the Civil War, it began using the Running W on the saddles and leather goods it produced. The brand is only to be put on goods of the finest quality. Today, the Running W appears on both prize-winning cattle and top quality leather goods, as an icon of American Ranching culture.</p>
    
                  <h5>What type of leathers does the King Ranch Saddle Shop offer?</h5>
                  <p>You will immediately notice the aroma and character that comes with each leather item you have purchased. The full grain leather we use is a classic but challenging material with which to work. Along with the beauty, which allows you to mix and match any of our leathers, you will discover a lot of priceless character on the various pieces. Our leather hides carry random markings earned from a spirited life among mesquite and cactus. The leathers used in all King Ranch merchandise are Docil, Latigo and Natural Saddle Leather. Docil Leather: Feel the softness of our smooth, supple, yet sturdy Docil leather. This wonderfully textured material gives each bag a unique shape with simple elegance. Latigo: We have taken this hard leather, traditionally used for bridles and reins, because of its toughness and durability, to bring you a smooth, rich, long-lasting leather. Latigo is often used as a trim on items made of soft, supple Docil Leather. These two types of leathers are available in Chaparral, Rio or sometimes Sombra colors. Natural Saddle Leather: We use the same thick, rugged natural leather traditionally used for our saddles and riding tack. Beyond their strength and endurance is the character each piece reveals as it ages to a golden tan from season after season of use.</p>
