                <p>The first layer of security, "Safe Technology", is the most visible to you. Our Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology is an industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. Using RSA key technology, our web server is stable and secure, so you can shop via the web without worry and without risk. We encrypt all of your personal information including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. The second layer, our "Firewall", works behind the scenes. We protect all of your private information, including your order, behind a network security system. Only our own staff has access to this information, and then only enough to service your order. As a final precaution, we authorize all credit card transactions through the same private channel that we use for traditional phone, fax, or mail orders. If you have any questions about our security system, please email us at krsaddleshop@king-ranch.com.</p>

                <h5>Warranty of Leather Goods and Canvas</h5>
                <p>Thank you for your King Ranch Saddle Shop purchase. Since the 1800s King Ranch has hand- made outstanding gear for ranchers and cowboys all over the world that would withstand the demands of all territories. If your leather item does not hold up to our high-quality manufacturing standards during the first three-years of ownership (from the date of purchase with a valid proof of purchase), we will take the proper measures to repair or replace your item at the discretion of our leather experts and cover your shipping. This warranty does not cover variations and unique characteristics such as scars, wrinkles or minor scratches that are natural to all leathers.</p>

                <p>Our leather goods warranty is meant to cover any quality issues related to the materials and workmanship of your product. We hope you understand we cannot replace or repair bags that have been damaged or not properly cared for. If our experts determine that your item has a manufacturing defect, we will take care of replacing or repairing your bag based upon our findings. As our supplies of leather and designs often change, we may not be able to replace or repair your bag with the same leather or style, but we will do our best.</p>

                <p>If your bag has damages from misuse, scratches or stains, airline/carrier mishandling or has lost the additional features included with the bag, such as but not limited to a key fob, wristlet or zip utility bags, the warranty is null. Normal wear and tear does not include missing hardware, torn fabrics or leather nor any cosmetic damage.</p>

                <p>Our Warranty of Leather Goods applies to luggage, handbags, hunting gear and briefcases. In addition, we will offer you a lifetime of cleaning and conditioning service on your leather item. Please be sure to schedule this service through one of our retail stores or if you are sending your bag, please include your name, shipping address, day-time phone number and let us know you would like your bag cleaned and conditioned. During peak season, bags will take longer to be worked on.</p>

                <p>Boots, Apparel, Wallets, and small leather goods such as Cigar Holders, Pen Protectors, Eyeglass Cases or Card Cases and accessories will fall under our standard 60-day Return Policy below.</p>

                <h5>How do I care for the leather or King Ranch Embossed Fabric?</h5>
                <p>Leather Care: The leather we use in our products will last for many years with proper care. In our experience, the best way to preserve leather is to condition the leather every 3 months with King Ranch Leather Conditioner (Item #223422). Use our leather cleaner (Item #222423)  to prepare the area for our Leather Conditioner. Do not use oil on any of our leather products. Doing so will turn the leather very dark.</p>
  
                <p>King Ranch Embossed Fabric Care: The tan-colored materials we use can be washed with water and any non-abrasive soap. If the material is marked by a ball point pen, it is important to remove the ink before it dries. The best choice for this is our King Ranch Canvas Cleaner (item#216939), 22 fl. oz. spray bottle.</p>
  
                <p>Spray it on the spot, let it work for 20 to 30 seconds and then wipe it off with a soft cloth. Do not scrub with a lot of pressure or you will dull the surface.</p>
  
                <h5>How often is the site updated?</h5>
                <p>We update our site on a daily basis. Be sure to check back often, as we are continually adding more exclusive products to our line.</p>
  
                <h5>What is the Running W® Brand?</h5>
                <p>The exact date of Captain Richard King's first use of the brand has not been determined. However, the earliest registration in Texas was on the 9th of February, 1869. There are several theories as to why the Running W was chosen. Some say it originated in Mexico because of its shape. The Mexicans call the brand viborita, which means the little snake. Others believe that it was a simple inversion of the initial M brand, because Captain King purchased the land and livestock of William Mann'?'s estate in 1862. When King Ranch began to operate its own saddlery in the years following the Civil War, it began using the Running W on the saddles and leather goods it produced. The brand is only to be put on goods of the finest quality. Today, the Running W appears on both prize-winning cattle and top quality leather goods, as an icon of American Ranching culture.</p>
  
                <h5>What type of leathers does the King Ranch Saddle Shop offer?</h5>
                <p>You will immediately notice the aroma and character that comes with each leather item you have purchased. The full grain leather we use is a classic but challenging material with which to work. Along with the beauty, which allows you to mix and match any of our leathers, you will discover a lot of priceless character on the various pieces. Our leather hides carry random markings earned from a spirited life among mesquite and cactus. The leathers used in all King Ranch merchandise are Docil, Latigo and Natural Saddle Leather. Docil Leather: Feel the softness of our smooth, supple, yet sturdy Docil leather. This wonderfully textured material gives each bag a unique shape with simple elegance. Latigo: We have taken this hard leather, traditionally used for bridles and reins, because of its toughness and durability, to bring you a smooth, rich, long-lasting leather. Latigo is often used as a trim on items made of soft, supple Docil Leather. These two types of leathers are available in Chaparral, Rio or sometimes Sombra colors. Natural Saddle Leather: We use the same thick, rugged natural leather traditionally used for our saddles and riding tack. Beyond their strength and endurance is the character each piece reveals as it ages to a golden tan from season after season of use.</p>
